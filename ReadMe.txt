Computer VisionSummary:This programming assignment involves writing a program to perform various computer vision tasks. The program consists of two stages. The Program:The program does the following:* Prompts the user to enter a file name. The program opens that file; the file will be a PGM image file. If the file does not exist, or is not properly formatted, the program exits.Stage #1:For stage #1, your program does the following:* Performs an average filter on the image, then save the result as “average.pgm”* Performs a median filter on the image, then save the result as “median.pgm”Stage #2:For stage #2, your does everything from stage #1, plus the following:* Performs edge detection on the image, then save the result as “edge.pgm”* Performs the Hough transform for line detection, then save the result as “lines.pgm”The PGM File Format:There are two versions of the PGM file format. The first looks like this:P2128 1282550 0 15 ...The first element is P2 (the version of PGM), followed by whitespace, followed by the width of the image, followed by whitespace, followed by the height of the image, followed by whitespace, followed by the maximum intensity of the image, followed by whitespace, followed by width * height grayscale values, separated by whitespace, such that the first value is the upper left pixel of the image.The second version looks like this:P5128 128255$^D&* ...This is the same header information, but the pixels are stored in binary, stored as unsigned characters. This is only possible if the maximum pixel intensity is 255.You might need to download some sort of image viewing program to look at PGM files (the default picture viewer on Windows will not open PGM files). I downloaded IrfanView, which works for PGM files. I think the default viewer on Macs works with PGM just fine.
